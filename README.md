# Unofficial Settlers 3 manual backup

I noticed the only online copy of this manual was a broken old Tripod site, so wanted to ensure it could be easily accessed properly.

Changes to make it work:
* Lowercased all the filenames / folders / extensions (thanks [Ant Renamer](https://antp.be/software/renamer)!)
* Converted all files to UTF8 encoding (thanks [Encoding Checker](https://github.com/amrali-eg/EncodingChecker)!)
* Added a landing page to pick between languages.
