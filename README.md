I noticed the only online copy of this manual was a broken old Tripod site, so wanted to ensure it could be easily accessed properly. Most of this manual is from [the History Edition](https://store.ubi.com/uk/game?pid=5be2b34288a7e3b8170265cf), with `/tips/` from [the Ultimate Edition](https://www.gog.com/en/game/the_settlers_3_ultimate_collection).

I had to make quite a few fixes to get this online (encoding, filenames, multiple editions etc), if you're interested in reading about them: https://blog.jakelee.co.uk/settlers-3-online-manual/

If you spot any broken links etc please [raise an issue](https://github.com/JakeSteam/settlers/issues), [tweet](https://twitter.com/JakeLeeUK), or [email me](mailto:settlers@jakelee.co.uk), thank you!
