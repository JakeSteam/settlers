I noticed the only online copy of this manual was a broken old Tripod site, so wanted to ensure it could be easily accessed properly. Most of this manual is from [the History Edition](https://store.ubi.com/uk/game?pid=5be2b34288a7e3b8170265cf), with `/tips/` from [the Ultimate Edition](https://www.gog.com/en/game/the_settlers_3_ultimate_collection).

Changes to make it work:
* Lowercased all the filenames / folders / extensions (thanks [Ant Renamer](https://antp.be/software/renamer)!)
* Lowercased all the links (thanks [freman](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/12185#issuecomment-516279301)!)
* Converted all files to UTF8 encoding (thanks [Encoding Checker](https://github.com/amrali-eg/EncodingChecker)!)
* Added a landing page to pick between languages.
