    residences, one, or even better two weapon smith's works as well as a barracks. As a rule,
    one barracks should be enough unless it happens to be located in a relatively menacing
    area and can not easily be defended. In this case, a second barracks would ensure that you
    have a fresh supply of troops that could be recruited if the first barracks were destroyed

    requires more manna than the one before. In order to promote all your soldiers to high

    very successful, but could get your enemy's border guards to leave their posts to repel
    your attack. Then one or more of your thieves would have the opportunity to cross the
    border unnoticed. Once they successfully infiltrate enemy terrain, they only have to avoid
    enemy patrols and find the best locations for a pinpoint attack. This kind of focused
    attack can cause substantially more damage than a massive blow against the peripheral
    areas of your enemy. Who is interested in destroying the third, fourth, fifth, sixth or
    even seventh pig farm? But when the enemy's only barracks and a key grain mill can be
    eliminated, that hurts.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Arial">You should be very careful that your thief is not detected
    because if this happens, your foe is aware that you </font><font color="#000000" size="2"
    face="Arial">have outsmarted him.</font></p>

    <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Provided that your opponent doesn&#146;t have a much
    smaller army, obvious weaknesses in his infrastructure or anything similar (information
    your thief can provide you with), but is about equally well developed, your task is to
    weaken him. And this is less a matter of decimating his soldiers than causing him serious
    problems in his chain of supply. After all, the entire complex infrastructure of the
    Settlers is not in place merely for their delight, but rather for the organization of a
    chain of supply.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Arial">In the Chapter &quot;The Protection of your Colony&quot;
    the sensitive points which you offer your opponent have already been drawn to your
    attention. Your foe, of course, has the same sensitive points. It is most likely nearly
    impossible to build up a colony completely free of one Achilles&#146;s heel or more. The
    mixture of terrain alone makes it difficult for him to be able to construct a building
    where he would like to, and now and again, there is simply no more room. And perhaps,
    where he has exploited the last bit of his land, he has neglected to build an
    appropriately strong tower or castle, manned with an adequate number of soldiers.</font><ul>
      <li><font size="2" face="Arial">Perhaps he has overlooked that you only need to take over
        two small guard towers to disrupt the transport of goods from the weapon smith to the
        barracks.</font></li>
      <li><font size="2" face="Arial">Perhaps he has overlooked that his mines for the most part
        lie perilously near his borders and are only protected by one guard tower.</font></li>
      <li><font size="2" face="Arial">How well are the iron smelter&#146;s works and weapon
        smith&#146;s works protected?</font></li>
      <li><font size="2" face="Arial">The grain mill, the bakery, the slaughterhouse. These are
        all buildings which are often only built singly. Where are the bottlenecks in your
        foe&#146;s infrastructure? How difficult would it be to reach this area? Is there a strong
        troop presence there? Could a feigned attack somewhere nearby serve as a diversionary
        tactic?</font></li>
      <li><font size="2" face="Arial">The combat strength of your enemy&#146;s soldiers depends on
        how many bars of gold he has stored up. Is there a storage area filled with gold that is
        perhaps inadequately defended? If you conquer this area, it could have a devastating
        effect on the fighting strength of your enemy outside his borders. This could possibly
        prevent him from paying your colony an unwanted visit.</font></li>
      <li><font size="2" face="Arial">The number of Settlers that your opponent can recruit
        depends not only on the number of Settlers. There must be residences for these Settlers.
        All those Settlers who have not yet been assigned an occupation or recruited into the army
        are paralyzed when their residence is destroyed and thus rendered useless. If you manage
        to destroy a middle-sized residence, he will have to first build a series of residences
        before he can again recruit soldiers.</font></li>
    </ul>
    <p><font size="2" face="Arial">By now, you've surely recognized the kinds of things to be
    taken into consideration. You'll come up with a lot of ideas yourself and with a little
    practice you'll become increasingly proficient in &quot;reading&quot; the infrastructure
    of your enemy and quickly recognizing his weak points. Your goal is in any case clear: an
    opponent who is as strong as you or stronger has to be weakened because an open battle
    against him can have at best a very uncertain outcome. And such a battle is much more fun
    when you have also won it.</font></p>

    <p><font size="2" face="Arial">It</font><font color="#FF0000" size="2" face="Arial">'</font><font
    size="2" face="Arial">s advisable to initiate the decisive battle only when you're fairly
    sure that you can win it. If this is case, that is, you have at least a moderate numerical
    superiority, some tips follow in the section &quot;The Stronger Position&quot;. If, on the
    contrary, you 're being attacked and the enemy is approaching with a legion of troops
    which clearly exceeds the size of your army, some tips (and a heartfelt &quot;Good Luck!&quot;)
    follow in the section &quot;The Weaker Position&quot;.</font></p>

    <p><font size="2" face="Arial">In the stronger position you should, above all else,
    proceed prudently. Take advantage of the room at your disposal. Beyond this, the simplest
    rules of strategy apply.</font><ul>
      <li><font size="2" face="Arial">Don't let your opponent lure you into a narrow enclosure
        where a small number of his troops can hold you up and where you could be exposed to a
        continuous bombardment of his bowmen's arrows. </font></li>
      <li><font size="2" face="Arial">Try to surround your foe. The broader the front, the more
        you can bring your superiority to bear.</font></li>
      <li><font size="2" face="Arial">Try to get some of your troops behind your opponent so that
        you can attack him from behind, where his bowmen are for the most part without protection
        and can be quickly eliminated.</font></li>
      <li><font size="2" face="Arial">Use your superiority to quickly deal the decisive death blow
        to the infrastructure. Take over everything which offers only moderate resistance. Then,
        if your military strength still allows, you can proceed with the coup de grace. If your
        foe&#146;s resources are gradually diminishing, you may want to let him stew a bit longer
        amid the remnants of his empire. Your infrastructure is still functioning! You won't have
        to wait long for the war of attrition to take its toll. </font></li>
    </ul>
    <p><font size="2" face="Arial"><a name="The Weaker Position"><strong>The Weaker Position</strong></a><br>
    <b><img src="linie450.gif" width="595" height="13"></b></font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Arial">To make it clear from the very beginning, if your opponent
    hasn't made any serious mistakes, your position won&#146;t be an easy one, but everyone
    can make mistakes, and some mistakes can be provoked. The following are a couple di</font><font
    color="#000000" size="2" face="Arial">versionary tactics that you might find useful.</font><ul>
      <li><font color="#000000" size="2" face="Arial">Be bold. Gather together half of your
        available troops and move them toward your enemy's colony. Possibly he's left parts of his
        colony vulnerable while preparing his attack. If you manage to attack some of his most
        important production centers, he'll probably be so diverted that your home front will only
        be facing a leaderless mass of foes. With no leader, even superior numbers can be
        vanquished. You should, at least, be able to avert the complete destruction of your colony
        since you'll be conquering enemy territory. With the damage that your enemy has to
        sustain, it could take a long time before he can prepare a new assault.</font></li>
      <li><font color="#000000" size="2" face="Arial">If you have a thick forest nearby which is
        favorably located, you could try dividing your troops and concealing half of them there.
        With a little luck, you might be able to attack your enemy's bowmen from the rear and
        eliminate a major part of the menace. Without the support of bowmen, any army is
        considerably weakened.</font></li>
      <li><font color="#000000" size="2" face="Arial">Try to lure the enemy army into an area
        where you have one or more castles so that your </font><font size="2" face="Arial">bowmen
        can be used to maximum effect. In the castle towers, they are at a distinct advantage as
        long as you are able to hold castle. </font></li>
      <li><font size="2" face="Arial">In narrow, enclosed terrain, you have the advantage of more
        targets for your bowmen than your opponent. Make use of this where possible!</font></li>
    </ul>
    <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Once again it must be said you're not confronted with an
    envious situation. Against an experienced opponent the game will probably soon be over.
    However anyone who doesn't clench his teeth, roll up his sleeves and do whatever else that
    might help, has lost from the very beginning. Even if you do go down in a blaze of glory,
    next time you can take care not to get into this situation again. Another look at chapter
    on the &quot;<a href="../ec_basic/main.htm" target="_top"><strong>Economy</strong></a>&quot;
    could also help. Good Luck!</font></p>
