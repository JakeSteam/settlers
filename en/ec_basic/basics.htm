    HEIGHT="145"><font size="2" face="Arial">The transportation of goods is the backbone of
    your economy. In order to accomplish most tasks you'll need materials (resources) of some
    kind, and these materials will have to be transported from location to location. Without a
    sufficient number of carriers, your economy will collapse, and when goods pile up at the
    source, production lines will halt.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Arial">For example: The miller needs wheat, which is carried from
    the farms to the grain mill, where the wheat is processed into flour. The baker in turn
    needs the flour from the mill and water from the waterworks to make bread. However, if no
    one ever comes to pick up the bread, the mineworkers go hungry and stop working.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Arial">You have to accept that the larger your territory becomes,
    the more complex your economy becomes; the more you produce, the more carriers you'll need
    to get the flood of goods where they are needed on time.</font></p>
    <p><img src="../images/buttons/navig/b87.gif" align="right" hspace="5" WIDTH="46"
    HEIGHT="32"><font size="2" face="Arial">You can determine the minimum ratio of carriers
    yourself, by clicking on the &quot;Settlers&quot; button in the Control Center</font><font
    color="#008000" size="2" face="Arial"> </font><font size="2" face="Arial">and then on the
    &quot;Occupations&quot; button. With the arrow buttons you can increase the minimum ratio
    of carriers, to say, 50%. As soon as you build your next residence, half of the new
    Settlers who are added to your colony will be carriers.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Carriers don't require any special tool, but can benefit
    from having multiple storage areas close by, thus minimizing travel time and increasing
    overall production.</font></p>

    </strong></font><img src="linie450.gif" width="595" height="13"></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Arial">An efficient production line will cause resource materials
    to build up, and soon some products won't be needed so urgently. Goods not in immediate
    demand aren't picked up, and pile up in front of the craftsman's door. When your craftsman
    sees that eight of his goods lie before his door and haven't been picked up; he sees no
    reason to get into a sweat and simply takes a break until his goods are needed again. This
    could lead to a situation where, for example, the stonecutter remains idle for a long time
    and then when another flurry of construction takes place, the eight blocks of stone
    quickly disappear, leaving you without the materials needed to finish construction on key
    buildings. You'll have to wait until he's cut the stone you need and it's been delivered
    to the appropriate location. Wouldn't it be nice if you could get him to produce more
    stone in reserve? This is the reason for storage areas.</font></p>
    <p><img src="../images/buttons/navig/b39.gif" align="left" hspace="10" WIDTH="45"
    HEIGHT="40"><font size="2" face="Arial">You can find the storage area in the
    &quot;Buildings&quot; menu under &quot;Misc.&quot; buildings. You'll need to designate
    everything that is to be stored in the storage area. You can do this in the
    &quot;Goods&quot; menu under &quot;Priorities&quot;. The goods marked in green are brought
    to the storage area, the ones marked in red stay at the doorstep of the respective
    craftsman.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Arial">In general, the goods most suitable for storage are those
    which aren't constantly needed: building materials, weapons and tools, and of course gold
    and gems. When your gold smelter takes a break because eight bars of gold lie before his
    door, the combat strength of your army cannot grow.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Arial">A storage area has enough capacity for six piles of goods
    with eight pieces of each good in each pile. Remember that building multiple storage areas
    every now and again is a must for maximum efficiency, if for no other reason than to
    stockpile gold reserves throughout your colony. </font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Important: Delivery of goods to building sites has priority
    over delivery to storage areas. No goods will be carried to a storage area as long as
    carriers are needed to supply a building site. If your carriers are in short supply, it
    would be a good idea to build a residence.</font></p>

    minimum) of builders and diggers in the same menu. Diggers clear and level the land so
    that a stable foundation can be constructed. It's important to note how steep the land at
    the building site is. The steeper the land is, the harder the diggers have to work to
    level and clear the land. Once the land has been levelled, the builders begin construction
    on the new building. The proportion of builders at the beginning of the game is relatively
    high and may be a bit too high for a thriving colony. During the course of the game you
    may see fit to decrease the maximum ratio of builders and diggers.</font></p>

    </font></b><img src="linie450.gif" width="595" height="13"></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Arial">In general, there are some important matters to consider
    while establishing an efficient infrastructure. Among them are: short transportation
    distances, sensible grouping of production centers, and an efficient use of natural
    resources.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Arial"><a name="Short Transportation Distances"><strong>Short
    Transportation Distances</strong></a><u><br>
    </u></font><img src="linie450.gif" width="595" height="13"></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Arial">In a real-time strategy game such as<em> THE SETTLERS III</em><i>,
    </i><b>time</b> is of the essence. Because your carriers are not world-class sprinters,
    you'll need to keep the transportation distances as short as possible. The overall design
    of your colony will determine the efficiency of your transportation system. Your entire
    economy can be brought to a crawl if just one element is slowing down the process. For
    example, let's say a sack of flour has to be carried from one side of the island to the
    other, just to get from the farm to the grain mill. This slows down the bread making
    process which in turn causes the miners to go hungry. The miners</font><font
    color="#00FFFF" size="2" face="Arial"> </font><font size="2" face="Arial">stop working,
    and your entire metal production stops. The smiths can't make tools or weapons, and thus
    your military growth is halted, leaving your colony vulnerable to attack from nearby
    enemies. Your kingdom for a sack of flour?</font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Another argument against long transportation distances is
    that these, naturally, can be more easily severed by your enemies. It's tough enough when
    your enemy gains control of an isolated pig farm, not to mention an entire food system.
    Soon you can no longer produce iron because your coal miners want ham if they are to work.
    Without iron, you can no longer arm your soldiers and soldiers without weapons don't make
    a very strong army.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Arial">If your territory doesn't offer an area large enough to
    construct all the buildings in a particular group (farm, mill, waterworks, bakery) it is a
    good idea either to make room in your territory by removing trees or stones, or crushing
    buildings that are no longer necessary. You can read more about making more room in the
    tip section <a href="../ec_build/building.htm#Make Room!">&quot;<strong>Make Room</strong>&quot;</a>.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Considering the importance of keeping transportation
    distances short, it seems logical to keep certain groups of interrelated production sites
    near one another.</font></p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p><a name="Sensible grouping of production centers"><font color="#800000" size="3"
    face="Arial"><strong>Sensible grouping of production centers</strong></font></a><font
    size="2" face="Arial"><u><br>
    </u></font><img src="linie450.gif" width="595" height="13"></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Success in <em>THE SETTLERS III</em> world will depend, in
    some measure, on the design of your infrastructure, particularly in a sensible grouping of
    your production centers. Please note that the various production centers are often
    interdependent of one another. For example, the mineworkers are dependent on the food
    industry, and their products are required for the heavy industry. If the transportation
    distance for the weapons to the barracks is too long, your military growth will take
    longer, offering your enemy an ideal scenario for a surprise attack. Poor weapon
    transportation results in a smaller army. It'll take a lot of practice to learn the best
    methods of production design and groupings, but with each game you'll get better and
    better.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Arial"><a name="The Building Industry"><strong>The Building
    Industry</strong></a><br>
    </font><img src="linie450.gif" width="595" height="13"></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Arial">The building industry, or those buildings not
    interdependent of any others to keep functioning, need to be placed in areas that
    correspond to their resource&#150;build woodcutter huts near forests, and stonecutter huts
    near stone. Try to maintain a balance between efficiency and distance between buildings.
    Over-building in well established areas can cause congestion, and might clutter up space
    that you could put to better use for, say, your food industry. The building industry also
    has the task of clearing the land to make as much space as possible for the other
    industries.</font></p>
    <p><font color="#000000" size="2" face="Arial">A stonecutter's hut needs no materials from
    other buildings, therefore it can stand alone, but shouldn't be too isolated. Most
    importantly it should be situated in an area with large quantities of granite. When there
    is no longer any more granite in the area, the stonecutter's hut can be demolished&#150;it
    is then only taking up space.</font></p>
    <p><font color="#000000" size="2" face="Arial">The ideal place to obtain wood is in a
    forest. Because the number of trees is variable by nature, it is a good idea to build a
    forester's hut in the middle of your wood-producing buildings. For the production of wood,
    you'll need some space, even if you already have a thick forest. So that the forest
    doesn't at some point overwhelm your colony, you'll need a couple woodcutters for a start,
    whose huts should be located as close to the forest as possible. Finally, you'll want to
    have at least one sawmill--depending on which race you're playing--which is ideally
    located between your woodcutters' huts and the place where the wood is needed.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Arial"><a name="The Food Industry"><strong>The Food Industry</strong></a>
    <br>
    </font><img src="linie450.gif" width="595" height="13"></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Arial">An important matter to note here is that the individual
    branches of production can be separated from one another. Meat productio</font><font
    color="#000000" size="2" face="Arial">n doesn't need to be in the immediate vicinity of
    bread production, and bread production in no way requires that beer production take place
    nearby. This could perhaps lead to a certain synergy, but as a rule, the effect would be
    small. </font></p>
    <p><font color="#000000" size="2" face="Arial">What's far more important is that the
    different groups or centers of production are well integrated.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Arial"><strong>Bread production:</strong> Grain farm Grain mill,
    Bakery, Waterworks.<br>
    <strong>Meat production:</strong> Grain farm, Pig farm, Slaughterhouse, Waterworks<br>
    <strong>Beer production:</strong> Grain farm, Waterworks, Brewery<br>
    <strong>Rice Wine production:</strong> Rice farm, Waterworks, Distiller<br>
    <strong>Mead production: </strong>Bee keeper's hut, Waterworks, Meadmaker's works</font></p>
    <p><font color="#000000" size="2" face="Arial">Two things are important here. First, a
    grain farm can't supply more than one other building effectively, simply because a single
    farm only produces enough wheat grain for one mill. Second, the food industry should not
    be too far away from your mines. The bakery and the slaughterhouse, being at the end of
    the food chain, should be nearest the mines.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Arial"><a name="Metal Processing Industry"><strong>Metal
    Processing Industry</strong></a> <br>
    </font><img src="linie450.gif" width="595" height="13"></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Metal processing should take place near the mines from
    which the raw materials are received.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Arial">The metal processing industry should be located very near
    the mines and in the case of the weapons smith, also not too far away from the barracks.
    The distance between the gold mines, gold smelting works, and the storage area should be
    kept minimal, too. In the long run, as your gold production expands, this distance will
    naturally increase &#150; this is almost inevitable &#150; but then is not so negative
    since the fighting strength of your soldiers increases with the production of gold bars
    and not after they've been brought to the storage area.</font></p>

    Production&quot;...</strong></a><br>
    </font><img src="linie450.gif" width="595" height="13"></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Lean production is a term you should become familiar with,
    as it's the means by which your colony will live and die. All buildings can be used either
    efficiently or inefficiently. Storage areas are a great way to maximize resource
    production. The storage area shouldn'tt be used indiscriminately as a solution for
    senseless overproduction. There are goods which are wisely produced in advance such as
    tools and weapons. There are also those goods that aren't used for further production
    purposes but have their value in other areas such as gold and gems.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Arial">For those goods to be produced in advance, a degree of
    moderation makes sense. If you have a pile of hammers without a gigantic construction
    phase in view, it may be wiser to change the adjustments for your tool smith or even stop
    production for a while. The same applies if your army has already assumed a respectable
    size and nevertheless more piles of swords, spears and bows lie unused in the storage area
    than you'll ever be able to use.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Arial">It can make sense to store building materials for shorter
    periods. With a little experience, it should be possible to keep the production of these
    materials at a comfortable level without having to rely too heavily on the storage area.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Arial">The storage of food products makes almost no sense at all
    because when they are not needed, their production is automatically reduced with the
    result that your farmers stop working as soon as the grain is no longer picked up. As soon
    as the grain is again picked up, the production resumes.</font></p>

    </font><img src="linie450.gif" width="595" height="13"></p>
    <p><font color="#000000" size="2" face="Arial">In order for a mine to operate at peak
    efficiency, it's important that it's built in a location with a high concentration of
    minerals. You'll need to have your geologist survey the mountainous regions to discover
    the locations of the different mineral deposits. The geologist makes note of this by
    putting signs in the areas where he finds each mineral. In order to get the most out of
    your mines, build the mine in the location corresponding to the highest concentration of
    each mineral. At the same time, you should also note that the mineworkers are most
    efficient when they can eat their favorite food. They work five times more efficiently
    when they eat what they prefer! A gold miner, for example, goes down into the mine ten
    times to extract gold when he's had a meal of fish, but only twice when he's had a meal of
    bread or ham.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Arial"><a name="Land Resources"><strong>Land Resources</strong></a>
    <br>
    </font><img src="linie450.gif" width="595" height="13"></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Arial">One observation can't be repeated often enough. What you
    lack most at the beginning is space. With the few soldiers that you have at your disposal
    at the beginning, you're in no position to conquer large amounts of territory. For this,
    you need weapons and these are only available in sufficient quantities after your
    infrastructure is well developed. Therefore, it's paramount at the beginning of the game
    to put the land you have to the best possible use. At this point, time plays a subordinate
    role. Developing a concentrated and thereby effective grouping of your main industries,
    food, metal production and metal processing, will certainly repay the investment in time.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Rework your land. Trees and granite offer no advantages in
    the area in which you've chosen to build your centralized complex of industries. Green
    areas are no doubt attractive but have no practical value where the shortest possible
    distances for transporting goods are needed. In this respect, our industrious little
    Settlers lean strongly in the direction of the pragmatic and less in the direction of the
    picturesque.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Arial">The same principle applies to buildings that you no longer
    need. Woodcutters and stonecutters have only a limited area in which they're effective
    even though you can change their work area. The longer the distance the product must be
    transported before it can be used, the more you should give thought to whether the
    building might be better off in another location. </font></p>
