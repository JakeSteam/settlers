    and the transport of goods can take place by land or sea. This section will describe how
    this functions in the SETTLER world. Trade and the transport of goods will first be dealt
    with generally. Then land transport and finally sea transport will be covered.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Trade is here taken to mean an exchange of goods between or
    among players. Transport of goods primarily serves the purpose of establishing a second
    colony and supplying it with the materials it needs until it has become self-sufficient.</font></p>

    <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Trade can only be carried out with human players. If you're
    allied with another player, trade is relatively free of risk. When you have an abundance
    of certain goods which a team member needs, trading with him helps the entire team. </font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Trade is more complicated when your trading partner is also
    your opponent. Nevertheless, this trade can be mutually profitable. Let's assume, for
    example, you're playing the Egyptians and your opponent the Asians. You don't have enough
    stone and your opponent lacks boards. </font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Provided that you both have built marketplaces, you can now
    trade with each other. Offer your opponent two boards for two stones. As long as your
    opponent keeps his side of the agreement and sends stones, you can continue trading. If
    your opponent reneges on the agreement, you have at most lost two boards - a reasonable
    risk. Trading with a computer opponent is not possible. </font></p>

    <p><font size="2" face="Arial">The map is still so big and your colony is still so small.
    How about establishing a second colony? You know how to recruit pioneers. You also know
    that you can send these pioneers outside your borders to occupy unoccupied territory by
    right-clicking on them while holding the &quot;ALT&quot; key down. As soon as you have
    annexed a large enough tract of land, you can convert some or all of the pioneers back
    into carriers. They will then be able to become diggers or builders when they have the
    appropriate tool at their disposal - a shovel or hammer.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Arial">If you now establish a trade connection with this newly
    occupied territory, you can transport everything there that you need for a second, small
    colony: shovels and hammers, boards and stones, saws, picks, axes, in short everything
    that you have lying at your disposal at the beginning of a game. Establishing a trade
    connection can either be done by land using marketplaces or by sea using transport ships.
    These will be described in more detail below.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Of course, you also need a couple soldiers. If there are no
    land or sea barriers between your starting colony and the newly acquired territory, they
    can go to your second colony by foot. If there are barriers, you'll have to send them by
    transport ship.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Arial">After you have the necessary goods, build a small guard
    tower and a residence. You can do without the tower if there are no enemies nearby. A
    weakly manned tower can also be attacked easily whereas land that you've acquired by using
    pioneers can only be occupied when your opponent sends his own pioneers or slowly makes
    his way there with towers. </font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Arial">As soon as your first residence is built, you should have
    enough Settlers to build up a self-sufficient infrastructure there. If you happen to have
    too many idle Settlers in your old colony, you can also forgo building a residence by
    making a troop of pioneers in the old settlement, sending them to the new colony and
    finally changing them back into carriers. To find out how many boards and stones you need
    to get started there on the first group of buildings,&nbsp; - a guard tower, a residence,
    a woodcutter's hut, a stonecutter's hut, a forester's hut and a sawmill - please consult
    the &quot;Table of Building Materials&quot; in the section on the economy. </font></p>

    To avoid this you can set up to three waypoints in such a way that your caravan
    circumvents enemy territory. To set waypoints you must be able to see these points. This
    means that one of your military Settlers - a thief, soldier, pioneer or geologist - must

    height="214" hspace="10" align="left">Simply click on the good that you wish to transport.
    A red square will appear around the good that you've selected as shown in the picture on
    the left. You can commission the transport of as many goods as you wish. You don't have to
    limit yourself to the load capacity of your ship. If all of the goods can not be
    transported at one time, the ship will automatically sail between the landing dock and the
    destination you've chosen until all of the goods have been transported. The number under
    each goods symbol shows how many of each good have currently been commissioned for
    transport. These quantities can be changed at any time using the buttons displayed below. </font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Arial"><img src="../images/buttons/Trade/T08.GIF" width="151"
    height="23" align="right">From left to right, the function of the buttons are as follows:</font></p>
    <p>&nbsp;<ul>
      <li><font size="2" face="Arial">Transport unlimited quantities of the good chosen.</font></li>
      <li><font size="2" face="Arial">Transport none of the goods chosen.</font></li>
      <li><font size="2" face="Arial">Transport 8 more units of the good chosen.</font></li>
      <li><font size="2" face="Arial">Transport 1 more unit of the good chosen.</font></li>
      <li><font size="2" face="Arial">Transport 1 less unit of the good chosen.</font></li>
      <li><font size="2" face="Arial">Transport 8 less units of the good chosen.</font></li>
    </ul>
    <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Before you can actually have any goods transported, you
    must first build a dock so that the goods can be loaded on board ship. You do this in
    about the same way that you do this for the dock near the shipyard. Click on the ship
    button&nbsp;<img src="../images/buttons/Trade/T07.gif" width="30" height="15"> and then
    right click in the water near the coast where you want the dock to be built. After the
    dock has been finished, all that remains is to set waypoints and a final destination for
    the goods you want to ship. This is done in the same way that you set waypoints and an end
    destination for goods transported by land from the marketplace.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Now it's only a matter of getting the goods on board the
    transport ship. This is quite simple. The trade ship only has to be brought near the dock
    and must have no other order to fill. The trade ship will be loaded automatically and will
    continue to transport goods until the last unit has been delivered to its destination.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Some experienced Settler players have indicated that it
    isn't always a wise idea to build a dock too near the shipyard because a newly-built trade
    ship is automatically put into service of the nearby landing dock when you might have
    wanted to use the new trade ship for another landing dock.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Arial">A landing dock can coordinate the activities of several
    trade ships. This allows a more rapid execution of the goods transported. From each
    landing dock, it is only possible to set one trade route, however.</font></p>

    <p><font size="2" face="Arial">In order to establish a trade route by sea, it is necessary
    to set a starting point and an end point, just as with trade routes by land. The starting
    point of the route in this case is always the dock. The end point or destination is up to
    you. It must be somewhere near a coast and accessible to ships. Here, as with trade routes
    on land, it is entirely up to you whether the destination for your goods lies in your own
    territory, in the territory of an ally or even that of an enemy.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Arial">By clicking on the button &quot;End of Route&quot; <img
    src="../images/buttons/Trade/T02.gif" width="32" height="15">, a window will appear asking
    you to select a target or destination. You can scroll, if necessary, with your right mouse
    button depressed to the location you wish. With a left mouse click you can then set your
    destination. You can also set the end point of your trade route by left-clicking on the
    desired location in the overview window. No matter which way you do this, a line of red
    posts should appear linking the marketplace with the end point you've chosen. If not, try
    again.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Arial">There are a few rules concerning trade routes by sea which
    are intended to protect you from unpleasant surprises. Do not choose as a destination a
    coast surrounded by small islands. The goods could be unloaded onto one of these small
    islands where they remain useless to anyone. The trade route by sea should also be
    positioned in deep waters, avoiding any archipelagos of small islands.</font></p>

    size="2" face="Arial">Of course, there can not always be open sea between your dock and
    your destination. So that you can more precisely set the route of your trade ships, it may
    be advantageous to set up to three waypoints. Setting waypoints for a trade route by sea
    is the same as doing so for a trade route by land.</font></p>

    </strong><img src="linie450.gif" width="595" height="13"></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Normally, goods are unloaded automatically at the end point
    of the trade route you've chosen. Be careful that no tiny islands lies near your end
    point. Your goods could then be unloaded onto one of these small sandbanks where they are
    inaccessible to any Settlers. This not only applies to goods, but also for Settlers. They
    can also be stranded on these treacherous sandbanks.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Arial">In order to unload your Settlers from the transport shop,
    you first have to get your transport ship near land. Select the transport ship and send it
    to the location along the coast where you want it. </font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Now select the Settlers standing on board the transport
    ship. In the menu on your left, you can click on the word &quot;Unload&quot;. Your
    Settlers will immediately disembark and await further orders from you.</font></p>
