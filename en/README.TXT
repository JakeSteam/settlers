Latest Information and Changes
------------------------------

Online Manual
=====================================
Just one of the many outstanding features built into THE SETTLERS III is our
Online Manual.
The Online Manual is a comprehensive look at the Settlers universe. It contains
helpful information concerning the economy, the military and overall
functionality of each industry within the game.
In order to gain the most benefit from the Online Manual THE SETTLERS III has
been designed so you can play the game and have the manual open at the same
time; as an online reference of sorts.  To do this, press the "Online Help"
button in the main menu before playing the game. THE SETTLERS III supports the
Windows ALT-TAB feature, which allows you to toggle between the game and
the manual with ease. This manual may also be referenced on your S3 CD1, in the
S3\Manual directory --> click on the main.htm file.


Troubleshooting
=====================================

Problems with Debuggers and System Monitoring Tools
===================================================

Please note that The Settlers 3 - Quest of the Amazons may not run correctly,
if one or more programs run simultaneously, which manipulate Windows' system
processes. Among those programs are debuggers and system monitoring tools,
such as McAffe's FirstAid. If you encounter any problems starting The
Settlers 3 - Quest of the Amazons please quit all those programs. In some cases
it may even be necessary to completely de-install the program in question (i.e.
McAffee's FirstAid).

Installing The Settlers 3 Mission CD after having installed The Settlers 3 - The
Quest of the Amazons
=====================================================================================================

In case you would like to install The Settlers 3 Mission CD after installing
The Settlers 3 - The Quest of the Amazons, you should copy the
latest Tips and Tricks manually from the Amazon-CD to make sure you have
the lastest version of the Tips and Tricks available.
The Tips and Tricks may be found in the folder S3QOTA\Tips on the Amazon-CD.
Simply copy the folder into your Settlers installation folder (i.e. C:\Settlers).

Voodoo 3 Graphics Adaptors
==========================

Make sure that you have the most recent driver for your Voodoo 3 graphics
adaptor installed. The driver must not be older than the Voodoo 3 Windows 9x
Retail Driver Version 1.02.11 or Voodoo 3 Windows NT Retail Driver Version
1.02.10. You can download the latest Voodoo 3 driver from the following URL:
http://www.3dfx.com .

Settlers 3 Level Editor V2.0 and Windows 95 A
=============================================

Please note that the new Level Editor V2.0 does NOT work under Windows 95 A.
Users of this Windows release should update to release B.

Setters 3 Level Editor: Memory Issues with "View Map In Game"
=============================================================
The editor function "View Map In Game" requires a lot of memory, because both
the editor and the game have to run simultaneously.
On systems with little memory (or on systems with hardly any virtual memory
left) this may cause warnings and error messages.
In this case you should load a map in the game manually after closing the
editor first. This is also recommended for systems with slow CPUs.

NT and Settlers 3 Level Editor
==============================
On some NT machines you might not be able to enter the "Victory Conditions"
dialog of the Settlers 3 Level Editor.
In that case, please install the Microsoft Service Pack 4 or Internet Explorer 4
or higher.

Saving Multiplayer-Games
========================
1.) For each multiplayer game, 1 saved-game file will be put on the hard disk of
the players participating in the game. During the game this file will be
successively overwritten. When you begin another game, a new saved-game file
will be created. If you play a very large map (the large random maps, for
example), these files can get very large (up to ca. 13 MB). Make sure that you
have enough space free on your hard disk.

2.) When a computer of one of the players cannot save the game and therefore is
thrown out, the game will be saved on the computers of the remaining players
(though there may be a longer pause). With the exception of the player whose
computer was not able to save the game, all the remaining players can continue
play and also load the saved game later. 
Possible causes for problems while saving could, for example, include:
-insufficient hard disk space (both for the saved game itself as well as for
virtual memory for Windows)
-a defective hard disk or one with cluster errors.

3.)  A game begun on a LAN can be continued in the Internet or vice versa.

Message "out of memory"
=======================
If you get a message reporting that your system has run out of memory, please check whether
enough free space for your swap file is available on your hard disk (drive C: in
most cases)

Intellimouse(r)
===============
Windows Explorer Error Message:
On some machines with the Microsoft(r) Intellimouse(r) wheel mouse an Explorer
error might occur when starting THE SETTLERS III. Our current understanding is
that this is an incompatibility between IntelliPoint 2.2 (the wheel mouse
software) and DirectX 6. The error message will disappear if you uninstall
IntelliPoint (thus removing the wheel features).
